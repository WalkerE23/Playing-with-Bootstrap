        <p>
          In the mobile age, we are moving away from the desktop and towards smartphones, putting interest in palm-sized devices with almost infnite capability. These devices have revolutionized day-to-day lives, where any data can be accessed instantly for consumption. Gone are the days of cumbersome desktop stations, as work, life, and play have been ported into our pockets.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens, however, when we lose capability during this transition? What if the ability to have total control over our data is lost? Apple's iOS devices have filesystems that lock out the user, and we are forced to concede control.
        </p>
        <p>
            With OnePlace, regain control of your files, organize them how you must with ease and security. Import them from the cloud, from other services, and from the desktop. Have files stored on the phone hardrive for instant access. Customized file viewer allows you to view all files from the same place.

          <h3>Native file systems</h3>
          <p>While iOS devices come pre-installed with iBooks, this is hardly the utility tool that most people desire. In order to unleash the full working capacity of iOS, users must be able to put their data where it is useful. The iPhone has no system of organizing files of all types in full-functional folders and directories. OnePlace solves this issue.</p>

        <div class ="col-md-4">
          <h3>Maximize use of personal files</h3>
          <p>With OnePlace, retain total control on mobile devices. Put data someplace useful: organize what you need, how you need. With personal and business files, have access immeditely without needing to download them every time. OnePlace's easy to use features allow the user to create, move, and interact with folders. The user is able to put any data anywhere they choose, and view it all from the same place</p>

          <h3>Integrations</h3>
          <p>OnePlace features integrations with the top cloud-hosted data platforms, such as Google Drive, iCloud, and Dropbox. Users are able to simply download any files from these other services directly onto the iOS system, and may do with them as they please within the OnePlace Terminal. </p>

            <p><b>Developer:</b> Elliott Walker, with help from Eric Carey</p>
            <p><b>Project:</b> NYU-Engineering Spring 2015 iOS class</p>
            <p><b>Source Code:</b> GitHub</p>
            <p><b>Published on iTunes:</b> Not currently</p>

            <p><b>OnePlace</b> is the product of an NYU-engineering class on iOS programming in Swift. It was taken at the same time as this CIMS class, and was the culmination of a semester of learning and work. For the class, we were to produce a fully functional iOS app, that could have any purpose we so desired.
            </p>
            <p>At the time, I had been in need of some way to have -and organize- files and documents from different classes. This included having completed works such as papers and responces handy on the phone for reference during class discussions. Moreover, the need arose to have pdf files already downloaded and accessible such that they could be easily accessed and read on the subway during a commute. Given the volume of documents that i wanted access to, organization was paramount, and iOS native apps did not give me what I wanted.
            </p>This was the premise on which OnePlace was founded: give optimal control of organization of files to the user.

This hook persists accross the entire operating system, and can be used in any place, making consolodation and organization that much easier. No Authorization is needed when importing, simply navigate yourself to a folder, hit the iOS share button, and select OnePlace. This minimal effort gives the user the opportunity to save the file directly to the harddrive for offline access, as well as optionally rename the file. </p>

      <h3>OnePlace is currently in a beta version.</h3>

      <p>OnePlace was completed per the milestones that it set out to accomplish within the scope of the iOS class. Therefore, it is neither ready to be pushed into production, nor has been submitted to the store. It is however at a working state, and with source code and an apple developer account it can be used live with a phone. It is a very interesting project that looks simple on the outside, but is quite complex internally.</p>

      <p>
        The source code is available online at github.com. It may be downloaded and modified, added to, or changed, with permission.
